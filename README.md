# Intro section with dropdown navigation

An implementation of a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5) in ReactJS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Try it [here](https://fm-intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-emmeryn.vercel.app/)!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Future improvements
- Animate the caret and mobile view menu when toggling their states
- Refactor duplicate code from `Dropdown.tsx` and `SubMenu.tsx`
- Add basic tests for the components (e.g. test that the correct number of items appear)
